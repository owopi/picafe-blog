Greetings fellow human, thank you for stopping by!

Our collective name is SriSur (Like Big Sur on MacOS 🤣), and I know nobody is going to find our little blog 🤏, but in the odd case that they do, hello!

We are simpletons from Canada 🍁, who are interested in many things, like tech, productivity, Linux and all the other shenanigans that come with it.

In real life, we're both pretty quiet, kind of like an introverted extrovert (or an ambivert for short 💀).

Either way, we still have no clue what we're going to write about here, so just uh, check out stuff for now. we'll update this place so that when you spread the info to your friends, you’ll actually know what your talking about.

Either way, thanks for stopping by!

So long, fellow human!,
