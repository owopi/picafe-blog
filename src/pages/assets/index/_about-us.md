Welcome to our tech blog! We started this blog as a way to share our **passion** for technology with the rest of the world.

Although we tend to focus on Linux guides and software, we also cover a wide range of topics including innovative new tech, cool productivity apps, and even occasional rants about pointless things. In addition to our regular blog posts, we also offer a newsletter that delivers the latest app findings straight to your inbox. We promise no spam!

If you have any requests for specific topics you'd like us to cover, don't hesitate to let us know. Thanks for stopping by; grab a cup of coffee and we hope you enjoy your stay at picafe!
