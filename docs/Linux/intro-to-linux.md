# Introduction to Linux

Date: October 29, 2022

Linux is a computer operating system (OS). Windows and macOS are also OSes. However, Linux is different than those OSes in numerous ways. It‚Äôs insufficient to simply say that Linux is an OS, as there is much more to say about it.

Here‚Äôs an example of what a Linux desktop could look like.

However, it doesn‚Äôt have to look like that. You could make it look like this:

Or even this!:

Don‚Äôt be intimidated by the terminal in the above images. It‚Äôs OK if you don‚Äôt know what it is. In fact, in this article, I may mention terms you‚Äôve never heard of, but that‚Äôs totally okay. I‚Äôm going to gloss over many concepts right now, but we will learn them in more detail later.

## Why use Linux?

### 1. Free

It‚Äôs completely free to install and use. For Windows, you have to pay a license fee (like $100 or so) which is usually included in the cost of your computer. Since Linux is free, you can install it by yourself on your computer without paying.

But that‚Äôs not all that I mean by ‚Äúfree‚Äù. The source code for Linux is ‚Äúopen source‚Äù. This means that anyone can view the code that makes Linux work. It also has no copyright restrictions. You are free to copy, modify, and distribute it as you wish. Even if _you_ aren‚Äôt a programmer, someone else _is_, and you‚Äôd be surprised how much of a difference that makes. I‚Äôll explain this in more detail later.

### 2. Extensible

This is a buzzword that‚Äôs thrown around a lot, so let me be specific. In Linux, you are able to use a command line to do regular computer stuff. The command line seems scary at first, but in reality, it‚Äôs very simple and usable. You can automate frequent tasks and use text files, streams, and pipes to do stuff you would have never imagined was possible. It‚Äôs just **easier** to do complex (and normal) stuff once you learn how to use it. There‚Äôs a pithy quote that sums it up in an amusing way:

> ‚ÄúGUIs make difficult things easy, and easy things impossible‚Äù

### 3. Customizable

Not just customizable in the sense that you can change the wallpaper or change the location of the dock, but rather you can change _any_ aspect of your system. For example, you can change the window manager, set custom keybindings (to do virtually anything you want), use whatever software you want, etc.

### 4. Lightweight

By ‚ÄòLightweight‚Äô, I mean that it can run on old hardware. Got an old laptop catching dust in the closet? It can run Linux, and it can run it well. Personally, I first installed Linux on my Chromebook (yes, full Linux on a Chromebook), and although it may be argued that it is slightly slower, it is much more capable and customizable than it was before! Linux is perfect for hand-me-down or old computers that run Windows slowly; it even runs (somewhat) smoothly on a 32-bit laptop from 13 years ago!

### 5. Efficiency

You can customize your workflow to be tailored to you so that you can be as efficient as possible. One popular thing among Linux users is to control your computer using only the keyboard. Switching windows, opening programs, browsing files, editing text, everything can be done using keyboard shortcuts. This eliminates the need to move your hand to your mouse, which some people find annoying and wastes their precious time. It may take some time to get used to, or you might not even like it; in that case, you can use it without. It‚Äôs all up to you!

### 6. Control

**You** control your Linux computer, not the other way around. The simplest example is that there are no forced updates on Linux, but it‚Äôs much more than that. You have the authority to make the computer do whatever you want; there‚Äôs no handholding (although there can be if you so choose). You control what background programs are running, how your computer handles key repeats, etc. This control entails 2 things: Privacy and Security. Since Linux is so user-controlled, it‚Äôs hard for it to collect data about you without you (or other Linux users) noticing and alerting the community. It‚Äôs really as if **you** own your computer. The security aspect comes mainly because hackers are disincentivized to write malicious software for Linux. Only a small fraction of computer users run Linux, and those who do run it likely know what they are doing and are thus less likely
to fall victim to their attack.

Additionally, most Linux programs are ‚Äúopen-source‚Äù, which means their code is publicly available for anyone to read. This means that if the author tries to sneak in some malicious code, someone will copy the entire code of the software, remove the malicious code, and re-publish it for everyone to use. Realistically, this means that malicious code doesn‚Äôt make it into the software in the first place since everyone knows that there‚Äôs no point in trying.

### 7. Software

There is a wide variety of software in Linux. You‚Äôd be surprised how many different programs there are for the same task. There are tons of different PDF readers, file managers, etc. Most of the software is written by people who do it for fun or for donations. Needless to say, all the software is free.

In Linux, there is a program called a package manager. We will talk about it in detail later, but in essence, it automates the process of installing software. Just run a single command in the terminal (or click a button in a GUI), and the software is installed. Even better, just run a single command, and all of the software on your computer is updated! No need to update every application you haven‚Äôt used in a while one by one.

### 8. Fun!

This is the most important reason to use Linux. It‚Äôs so interesting learning about how your computer works and how you can tweak it. You will come to love messing with your system, taking it apart to see the internals function, and finding clever solutions to problems. It‚Äôs a better type of fun than watching YouTube videos or TV shows. But make sure you exercise since running Linux is not the same as actually running! üòÑ

## FOSS

Let me explain what Free and Open Source Software (or FOSS) is. You are likely to hear this abbreviation a lot in the context of Linux. You might even hear of ‚ÄúLibre Software‚Äù, which means the same thing. FOSS refers to a type of software (or more specifically, a type of software licence) which allows anyone to run, copy, modify, and distribute it with no restrictions. This is a complicated and controversial topic, but I‚Äôll try to keep it short here. Anyone who knows how to can download the source code of a FOSS program (which is open-source), make changes, and release it to the public (which is a process known as ‚Äòforking‚Äô). The biggest point here is that **EVEN IF YOU DON‚ÄôT KNOW HOW TO PROGRAM**, someone else **DOES**, so you can still benefit from it.

Two more related abbreviations you are likely to run into are **GNU** and **FSF**. The FSF or Free Software Foundation is a non-profit that advocates for free software. GNU stands for ‚ÄúGNU‚Äôs Not Unix‚Äù (it‚Äôs a recursive acronym. Look it up, it‚Äôs pretty cool), and it‚Äôs the name that the FSF gave to their free operating system, which we call Linux. The FSF wrote a bunch of the core programs that you run on Linux, but we ended up calling it Linux instead of GNU or GNU/Linux for various reasons that don‚Äôt really matter (You can always look it up!).

## Cons

Now let me mention a few disadvantages of using Linux. I‚Äôm not saying that you shouldn‚Äôt use Linux; these are just some of the challenges you will likely face.

### 1. Steep Learning Curve

When you first get started with Linux, there is a lot to learn. To get the most out of Linux, you will need to learn many concepts and terms at first, but later on, you can reap the benefits. The biggest
obstacle is learning the jargon: It sounds complex and difficult, but it‚Äôs really not. At first, you may think Linux is some ‚Äúscary hacker stuff‚Äù, but you will come to realize that‚Äôs not the case. Rather, Linux can be a very usable OS if you know how to use it. When I started using Linux, I had absolutely no clue what I was doing either!

### 2. Takes time to learn

To overcome that steep learning curve, you will need to spend some time. There‚Äôs not much else to say about this.

### 3. Not many people use it

Do you know anyone who uses Linux? Likely not. If you encounter a problem you don‚Äôt know how to fix, and tutorials on the internet don‚Äôt make sense to you, you won‚Äôt have anyone to ask for help! This exacerbates the first two disadvantages.

## But‚Ä¶

The astute among you may have noticed that all 3 of the disadvantages listed above have something in common: we can help you with all of them. This is the central reason that I started Linux Club. I wanted to lessen these disadvantages and help you benefit from using Linux. Let me elaborate. I can help ease the learning curve by teaching you and giving personalized answers to your questions/problems. It‚Äôs much better to have a real person teaching and guiding you in Linux than stumbling around on the internet following random tutorials (which is what I did). This will lessen the time it takes for you to learn the concepts, which addresses the 2nd disadvantage. Thirdly, you can always ask me to help you with specific problems that you encounter. Now you know at least one person who uses Linux!

Side note: In case you guys are worried that some software that you use (or are forced to use for school) will not be available on Linux, there is something called ‚ÄúDual-booting‚Äù, which means you can use both Windows/macOS and Linux on the same computer, and you can choose between the two every time you start your computer. So don‚Äôt worry. Personally, I‚Äôve come across very few situations when I absolutely had to start Windows, but it‚Äôs comforting to know that it‚Äôs there.

Lastly, I‚Äôd like to leave you with an amusing quote about Linux that often floats around the internet:

ü§î Linux is user-friendly. It‚Äôs just selective about who its friends are.
