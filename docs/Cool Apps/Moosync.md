Another music app, except this, includes everybody('s operating system except the mobile users [üò¢](https://discord.com/assets/f6d30507f4baee759bc9d7e5c0d3ba4f.svg)), Moosync! Moosync is another open-source music app, built by an awesome dev on Github named‚Ä¶Moosync! [‚ùì](https://discord.com/assets/3e531d8e171629e9433db0bb431b2e12.svg), and it aims to provide users with an all-in-one streaming platform, allowing users to import their Spotify and Youtube playlists, to be played on the player. It's built on top of electron, which means it has a bit of lag, however, it more than makes up for it in terms of usability, from a dedicated jukebox mode to the ability to rebind any shortcut keys, this app takes its game to the next level. Worth a shot, especially for the cool dev behind it!
