# Hello From The picafe Team

Welcome to the picafe guides section! Here, we have a bunch of guides, mainly Linux-focused content by @Surya and Windows-focused content by @Orca. We provide casually-written guides in an easy-to-understand way, as we want to make learning stuff fun and easy, so you can sit back and enjoy your coffee! We cover topics such as command-line tools, desktop environments for Linux, and more. We have beginner-friendly tutorials, as well as more advanced topics for power users. We make sure to keep our content fresh and up-to-date, so you can always stay ahead of the curve.

Feel free to get in touch with us at <u>contact@picafe.dev</u> if you have any questions or suggestions!
