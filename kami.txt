Hey, kami here!

First of all, I'm impressed you found this text! Did not expect anyone to extract the embedded data of this file!

Anyways, introductions over! I'll go through what I've done and how you can find me if you intend on it!

I made search.html template for owopi, the test.js for the searching of things and the smth.json!

Dm 631223397678055439/owopi#8802 on discord and tell him to dm kami Nec possum tecum vivere, nec sine te, YourNameHere.

This would be a fun minigame if you would like to try it out also, you can add any content after the full stop!

I'll probably prepare another fun minigame (Hope it will/was fun if you did try dming.) if you did indeed dm owopi!
