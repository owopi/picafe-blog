# Top 10 Best GTK Themes

Good evening, wonderful internet people; weâ€™re back yet again with the best GTK themes to spice up your desktop because imagine using default themes in 2022. We are using stock Pop!_OS in the screenshots to display the theme, although you can do much more customization yourself if you so desire. Letâ€™s get right into it!

## 1. Catppuccin

Catppuccin Mocha (no colour) Version

This one is for you for all those cafe-loving cat (or cat cafe) people out there! Unless, of course, youâ€™re into espressos rather than cappuccinos.

There are many, many options and colours in the GitHub Releases; check them out for yourself!

If you really like this colour scheme, you can use it for [a lot more](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) than just your desktop.

## 2. Nordic

Nordic Darker Version

For all the Viking and Norse mythology fans, here is the Nordic theme (Nordic doesnâ€™t mean Norse, by the way).

Overall, itâ€™s an excellent theme for those who like winter!

## 3. WhiteSur

WhiteSur Dark Version

As you can tell, this theme was inspired by macOS. Thatâ€™s right, we took the light theme and made it dark. Thatâ€™s how much we hate light mode! 

Anyways, the WhiteSur repository has more than just a GTK theme. You can go as far as making your GNOME desktop environment look exactly like macOS! It even has its own [icon pack](https://github.com/vinceliuice/WhiteSur-icon-theme) (which looks extremely clean).

## 4. Layan

Layan Dark Version

The Nautilus sidebar looks very cool, although besides that, itâ€™s not much.

## 5. Gruvbox

Gruvbox Dark with Borders

My favourite theme, with the slight orange hints and a warm colour palette, leaves me feeling chill and warm during those late-night study sessions. ðŸ”¥

## 6. Graphite

Graphite Dark Black Version

Good stuff, now you wonâ€™t blind yourself looking at your file managerâ€¦ except for the sidebar, itâ€™s pretty bright.

There are many variants (like Nord) to this theme too; itâ€™s worth checking out!

## 7. Juno

Juno Standard Version

Damn, that looks nice; I like the colour palette. It gives an ocean vibe. There are quite a few variants too.

[Juno](https://www.gnome-look.org/p/1280977)

Notice: The theme does have a few flaws that I experienced and are summed up well by the [open issue](https://github.com/EliverLara/Juno/issues/51) on the themesâ€™ GitHub page.

## 8. Dracula

![Dracula Standard Version](./assets/dracula-gtk.png)

Dracula Standard Version

Dayum, this thing has a GTK theme too. I see it almost everywhere, from Obsidian to VS code. I hope it keeps growing!

## 9. Orchis

![Orchis Standard Version](./assets/orchis-dark-blue-gtk.png)

Orchis Standard Version

That orange backspace button hits hardâ€¦

Otherwise, itâ€™s a pretty solid theme with a few variants/tweaks you can use to customize it further.

## 10. Qogir

![Quogir Dark Version](./assets/qogir-dark-gtk.png)

Quogir Dark Version

Finally, I get to go home; this theme looks kind of meh.

The Nautilus sidebar looks cool, but the theme is a bit square and dull. However, you can change the windows buttons to be similar to the ones on Windows if thatâ€™s what you want.
